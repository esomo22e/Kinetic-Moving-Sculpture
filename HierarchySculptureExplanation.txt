				Hierarchy Sculpture

My sculpture imitates a scene of people and animals in a forest and it has 5 levels of hierarchy. The different people and animals are doing different activities throughout the forest in the moonlight. Also, the circle rotating  is rotating to show the light and the shadows that happen during day and night. I thought that was visually interesting. The sculpture of the object is moving in a hierarchical manner because each level is rotating under each level's middle axis with different speed. Level 1 is rotating around its middle axis, and while it rotating level 2 is rotating around its own middle axis, then its own level 3 is rotating around its middle axis, and so on. Each level rotate at a speed starting from 1.0f and ending at 2.1f at the 1st level  and gets slower by 0.3f at each level. Each level shows different part of the forest where the animals, plants, and humans are residing. The 1st level is represent the sun/moon which represent a day and night effect. The second level are a group of birds relaxing and chilling and being happy. The third level is a group of trees somewhere else in the forrest because there are trees all over the forrest. The 4th level represent a group of campers who are deciding if they want to feed the bunny because it is cute or kill the bunny because they have no food. The 5th level represent a woman setting up camp under a tree. 

I want to add all 5 levels because it adds to the story I made up and because I added the sun/moon last.
